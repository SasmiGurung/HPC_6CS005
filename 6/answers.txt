The main difference between two program is the way threads is created and joined. The first program creates the thread and doesn't wait or reserve the threads to terminate due to which when threads which completes tries to terminate the program without waiting completion of other threads. While second program reserves every thread and track every thread which then waits every thread for its completion. Due to this, second program exactly creates 500000 threads but first program terminates before completion of all threads, so random numbers of created thread is observed.
